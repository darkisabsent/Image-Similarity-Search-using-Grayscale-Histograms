# Image-Similarity-Search-using-Grayscale-Histograms
This project builds a basic image similarity search system using grayscale histograms. It indexes images and finds the closest match to a query image based on Euclidean distance between histograms. Designed for learning, it showcases fundamental image processing and similarity search concepts.
